- The corresponding dice image is displayed based on the random number generated for each player.
- The game compares the random numbers of both players:
- If the random number of Player 1 is greater than the random number of Player 2, Player 1 wins.
- If the random number of Player 2 is greater than the random number of Player 1, Player 2 wins.
- If both random numbers are equal, it's a draw.
